## **ðŸ“¦ E-Commerce SQL Data Analysis Project**

This project demonstrates how to extract, manipulate, and analyze structured e-commerce data using **Microsoft SQL Server**. The dataset contains tables for **Customers**, **Products**, **Orders**, and **OrderDetails**, allowing real-world business queries and insights.

### **Key Features**

* **Basic Queries** â†’ `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and `GROUP BY` for filtering, sorting, and aggregating data.
* **Joins** â†’ Implemented `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and `RIGHT JOIN` to combine data across multiple tables.
* **Subqueries** â†’ Used nested queries to extract the top-spending customer and other insights.
* **Aggregate Functions** â†’ Calculated `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, and other metrics for business reporting.
* **Views** â†’ Created reusable views such as `top_customers` for frequently used analyses.
* **Indexes** â†’ Added indexes on `country` and `order_date` columns to optimize query performance.
* **MS SQL Server Compatible** â†’ All queries are written in syntax compatible with Microsoft SQL Server.

### **Technologies Used**

* **Database:** Microsoft SQL Server
* **Language:** SQL (T-SQL)
* **Tools:** SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
* **Dataset:** Custom-built e-commerce dataset with realistic customer, product, and order data
